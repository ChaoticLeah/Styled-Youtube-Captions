## How to use it?

1. Get a .vtt file from youtube.
    - Go to YouTube studios caption section on a video
    - Select the autogenerated captions and copy them.
    - Make some changes to these new captions and make sure all the text is correct
        - If you dont make any edits there is a known bug where your .vtt file wont load properly. For now just make a small edit like adding a space or something in studio and saving it.
    - Download the captions from studio as a .vtt
2. Open the tool and upload the .vtt file
3. Make any edits you want
4. Export and enjoy!
